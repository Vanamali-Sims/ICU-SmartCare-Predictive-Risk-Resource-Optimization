# MedSentry: An AI-Powered ICU Workflow Orchestration
<br>

## Overview
**MedSentry** is an advanced real-time predictive model designed to improve patient monitoring, optimize ICU resource allocation, address time sensitivity and reduce unnecessary alarm fatigue and clinical uncertainty. 

Our AI-powered ICU Command Center turns this three-front war into winnable battles through predictive precise modelling, with continuous enhancements being made to improve accuracy, usability, and impact.

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Enhanced Patient Risk Assessment**
- Incorporates multiple scoring mechanisms beyond traditional ICU risk scoring.
- Uses a **blended risk score** based on established clinical metrics.
- Aims to provide a more holistic and **trustworthy** risk evaluation for critical care patients.

### 2. **Improved ICU Resource Utilization**
- Calculates **real-time Lenght of Stay**, ensuring efficient resource management.
- Offers **dashboard integration** for quick and effective decision-making.
- Assists medical staff in making data-driven decisions about **patient admission and discharge planning**.

### 3. **Reduction in Alarm Fatigue**
- Introduces **smarter alert mechanisms** to minimize false alarms, preventing unnecessary stress for healthcare professionals.
- Uses **refined risk scores** to filter out low-priority alarms and only trigger alerts when intervention is genuinely required.
- Aims to **improve patient outcomes** by ensuring timely and accurate responses to critical conditions.

## Current Development Status
