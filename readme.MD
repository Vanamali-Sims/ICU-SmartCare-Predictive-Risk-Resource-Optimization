# MedSentry: An AI-Powered ICU Workflow Orchestration

## Overview
**MedSentry** is an advanced real-time predictive model designed to improve patient monitoring, optimize ICU resource allocation, address time sensitivity and reduce unnecessary alarm fatigue and clinical uncertainty. 

Our AI-powered ICU Command Center turns this three-front war into winnable battles through predictive precise modelling, with continuous enhancements being made to improve accuracy, usability, and impact.
